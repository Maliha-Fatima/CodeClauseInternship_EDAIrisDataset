**Exploratory Data Analysis on the Iris Dataset**
This project demonstrates how to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the widely-used Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of measurements of iris flowers from three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.
The aim of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, uncover insights through visualization, and prepare the data for potential machine learning applications.

About the Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

Sepal Length (cm): Length of the sepal
Sepal Width (cm): Width of the sepal
Petal Length (cm): Length of the petal
Petal Width (cm): Width of the petal
Species: Species of iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
The dataset is well-suited for EDA as it includes clear, structured data for analysis and visualization.

Project Objectives

Understand the Dataset: Explore the structure, distribution, and relationships within the Iris dataset.
Visualize Insights: Generate meaningful plots to interpret trends and patterns.
Data Preparation: Handle missing values, outliers, and normalization if needed.
Feature Engineering: Highlight important features that can impact predictive modeling.
Correlation Analysis: Study interrelationships among features to identify influential attributes.


Features and Tools

This project utilizes Python with the following libraries:

NumPy: Numerical computing
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
